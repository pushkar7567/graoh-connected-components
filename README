Weekly Exercise #5: Graph Concepts

Included Files: 
	*graph_concepts.cpp
	*digraph.cpp
	*digraph.h
	*Makefile
	*README

Notes and assumptions:
  I used the files given on eclass under weekly exercise section from "starter code" as a starting point as indicated in the exercise description. It is assumed graph_concepts.cpp, digraph.cpp, digraph.h, Makefile are in the same directory while running the code. 

Running instructions:
  1. While in the folder containing file graph_concepts.cpp file, type "make graph_concepts". This creates exercise4.o, exercise4 (executable file).
  2. After it comples, you can input edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt file using "./graph_concepts edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt" which will give the desired output

Notes:
  The  file contains 2 implemented function namely count_components() which counts the number of seperate trees for a given digraph class instance. read_city_graph_undirected functio takes a file input to take vertices and edges as inputs. Calling this function results in giving the number of connected trees for a given file.
